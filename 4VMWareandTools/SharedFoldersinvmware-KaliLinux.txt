when we enable shared folders, in some OS vm it will show up as mounted folder.

but if it does not ( e.g kali linux then)

first enable and add a shared folder ( dont set it as read only , set it as always enabled)


and always open vmware.exe as the windows / host user account you have logged into.

According to this the shared folder on the guest is supposed to appear in /mnt/hgfs but the last folder was missing on my system. Open a terminal window in the guest, and create the missing folder:
cd /mnt
sudo mkdir hgfs

sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o allow_other

My way of solving this issue is to resort to vmhgfs-fuse installed with open-vm-tools.

Either mount locally using vmhgfs-fuse .host:/$(vmware-hgfsclient) ~/some_mountpoint or globally using sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o allow_other. To then make mounting globally persistent add the following line to your /etc/fstab:

.host:/ /mnt/hgfs fuse.vmhgfs-fuse allow_other 0 0

will show up at : 
/mnt/hgfs/NAMEOFSHAREDFOLDER/
