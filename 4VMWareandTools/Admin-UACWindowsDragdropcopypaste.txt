always run vmware.exe as the user you have logged on, don't run it as admin

the explorer.exe file in windows  will run as the current user, so there is a mismatch.

and we cannot drag and drop or copy and paste files / text this way..

if we run vmware.exe without run as administrator ( right click exe properties.
deselect run as administrator, then we can copy and paste and drag and drop )

also

in vmware in guest isolation settings :
enable drag and drop
enable copy and paste
