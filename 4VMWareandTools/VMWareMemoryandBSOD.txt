By default, vmware uses memory settings in multiples of 4MB.

if we have 16GB RAM. then memory swapping will occur beyond the 13.4 gb size limit.


This will give the BSOD, page fault in non paged area.

the solution is to set and allocate only physical memory and RAM to vmware,
and not allow the memory swapping.

also keep number of processors to 1, and number of cores to 1.


to disable vmware swapping memory , go to preferences -> memory.


We dont need Virtual CD DVD
we dont need virtual usb adapter
we only have to use single network adapter

run vmware in standard user mode.
keep vmware on single monitor screen while doing drag drop / copy paste.

fix all physical memory before startup.
