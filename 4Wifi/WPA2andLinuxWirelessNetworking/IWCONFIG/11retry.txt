retry
Most cards have MAC retransmissions, and some allow to set the behaviour of the retry mechanism.
To set the maximum number of retries, enter limit 'value'. This is an absolute value (without unit), and the default (when nothing is specified). To set the maximum length of time the MAC should retry, enter lifetime 'value'. By defaults, this value in in seconds, append the suffix m or u to specify values in milliseconds or microseconds.
You can also add the short, long, min and max modifiers. If the card supports automatic mode, they define the bounds of the limit or lifetime. Some other cards define different values depending on packet size, for example in 802.11 min limit is the short retry limit (non RTS/CTS packets).
Examples :
iwconfig eth0 retry 16
iwconfig eth0 retry lifetime 300m
iwconfig eth0 retry short 12
iwconfig eth0 retry min limit 8
