DO NOT CONNECT THE USB WIFI ADAPTER IN USB 3 , SUPER SPEED PORTS
connect it to the black USB port.
otherwise it will not work and give bsod


the usb wifi adapter works on older linux kernels due to firmware and driver issues... so choose the linux operating system according to the documentation..

in our case, its ubuntu 16.4.4
tp link 725n..

any other adapter and any other linux can work, but 
we are using this config.

open vmware in host pc in standard user
wait for vm to turn on
disconnect from ethernet.

connect usb wifi adapter in vm

choose option : connect this usb device to virtual machine.

The device 'Realtek 802.11n NIC' was unable to connect to its ideal host controller. An attempt will be made to connect this device to the best available host controller. This might result in undefined behavior for this device.


connection activation failed (24) Timeout was reached


this happens because virtual machine configured ethernet to be used
instead of wifi, and because network manager has an issue with entering passwords,

so what we can do is that

unplug the usb wifi adapter,
stop network manager and networking services.
restart the network manager services

then the usb wifi adapter will work.
