VMNet2
and so on..

these are virtual network adapters in windows 10 host OS.
windows 10 needs admin privilege to configure these virtual network adapters.

we need to allow vmware.exe app through the Windows Firewall if we run it in
non-admin, standard user mode.

also at 1 time , if bridged mode is enabled, and you have also previously used the
NAT network adapter or host only adapter and it was enabled. the virtual machine and
virtual network manager assigns those ips to the virtual machine. through the router.

so inorder to fix this,

1. disable the virtual network adapters for NAT and host mode.
2. delete the devices through the router.
3. shut down the virtual machine
4. configure virtual machine network adapter mode ( through vmware)
5. turn virtual machine on

if the virtual machine still does not connect to the internet then : 

for e.g it gets ip from router, as well as the mac address, then

shut down virtual machine
shut down vmware
shut down the router.

restart host os
restart router
restart vmware
start the virtual machine in A SINGLE NETWORK ADAPTER MODE. ( either bridged, or NAT or hostonly)


then check for the internet connectivity.

if it still does not work

then the antivirus and firewall programs are blocking the access.
so either allow vmware.exe file through firewall.

or run all programs as administrator.


( Windows explorer does not run has administrator ( as well as other programs )

so we have to run an elevated powershell window in windows os
and run whatever program we need to copy paste from or drag and drop from

and then copy paste to the virtual machine )

VMWare also causes issues with any unknown drivers
any USB virtual adapters.

( basically delete windows and boot linux directly ) :|
