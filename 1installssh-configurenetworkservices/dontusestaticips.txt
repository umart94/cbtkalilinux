on desktop pc, static ip causes issues due to using usb wifi adapter with guest virtual machine

the driver can have issues
the static ip has issues with virtual machine and firewall

instead,

use laptop for wireless network analysis. and seperate virtual machine.


troubleshoot static ip issues:

after setting static ip

run

ifconfig 192.168.100.109/24 up

ifconfig eth0

route add default gw 192.168.100.1

we need to tell the OS to use this router gateway to go to external networks.

/etc/resolv.conf

must have the 

nameserver 192.168.100.1

update-rc.d networking defaults

after updating static ip , device boots slower, so create snapshots of vm if there are issues.

otherwise just use dhcp.

update-rc.d -f ssh defaults
