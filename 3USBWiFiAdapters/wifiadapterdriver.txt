vmware virtual box virtualize pci devices

we can use the built in wireless 

but for packet sniffing and injection we have to use a seperate USB WiFi Adapter.
that will connect to virtual machine directly.

enable the setting : connect any usb that connects to this machine directly to vmware
instead of connecting first to host to avoid errors.

You have 2 versions of the same driver loaded. That doesn't work.

r8188eu is lwfinger's standalone driver (a bit old too) which comes with kernels upstream

8188eu is our (aircrack-ng) and also newer then the other. The driver has monitor mode, frame injection, MESH support etc. See README.md.

According to our README.md, you need to blacklist the older "standalone" driver (by lwfinger) by adding a .conf file in /etc/modprobe.d (e.g: echo r8188eu > /etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf) and then reboot in order to unload/blacklist it (or modprobe -r 8188eu)

Our drivers support a wide range of kernels and are heavily maintained. As of now, it supports the latest, v5.3+.
