During April 2016, Pakistan’s Telecommunication Authority (PTA) published a new notification S.R.O 287(I) 2016 for WiFi device usage. Changes to the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz ISM Bands are as follows:

·         The 2.4 GHz Band is now fully open; it was previously restricted to 2.4735-2.4835 GHz only. Maximum Permitted Output Power is 30 dBm EIRP.

·         The output power for the 5.725‑5.875 GHz band has been increased from 20 dBm EIRP to 30 dBm EIRP.

 

Additionally, PTA recently confirmed that all the standalone RFID and NFC have been exempted from type approval.

Under the new requirement,  PTA will approve mobile phones according to the standards listed below:
